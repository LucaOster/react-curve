# Pomodoro Timer

- The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. 
- Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. 
- These intervals are referred to as pomodoros
